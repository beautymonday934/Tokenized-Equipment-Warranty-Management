# Tokenized Equipment Warranty Management

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based system for managing equipment warranties through tokenization. By creating digital representations of physical assets and their warranty terms, this solution enables transparent, verifiable, and efficient warranty management for equipment manufacturers, service providers, and owners.

- Stores ownership information with secure transfer capabilities
- Maintains technical specifications and configuration details
- Enables equipment authentication through secure digital identifiers

### Warranty Terms Contract
- Defines coverage periods and conditions for tokenized equipment
- Manages warranty activation and expiration timestamps
- Stores detailed warranty limitations and exclusions
- Implements automatic warranty updates for extended coverage
- Provides real-time warranty status verification for all parties

### Service Request Contract
